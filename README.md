# Potato-Disease-Classification
<br>
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify potato plant health based on leaf images. The model can detect and differentiate between three classes:
1) Early Blight
2) Late Blight
3) Healthy

Contents
1)saved model/: Contains the trained model files.
2)model code/: Jupyter notebook for model training and evaluation, along with the dataset.
3)README.md: This file with project description.

Features
1)Image-based classification of potato leaf diseases.
2)Uses deep learning to accurately detect Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves.
3)Includes data preprocessing and model training steps.

How to use
1)Load the saved model from the saved model/ folder.
2)Use the notebook in model code/ to explore training and testing.
3)Modify the code or dataset as needed for your experiments.
