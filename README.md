# Potato-Disease-Classification
<br>
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify potato plant health based on leaf images. The model can detect and differentiate between three classes:
<br>
1) Early Blight
2) Late Blight
3) Healthy

<h4> Contents </h4>
<br>
1)saved model/: Contains the trained model files.
2)model code/: Jupyter notebook for model training and evaluation, along with the dataset.
3)README.md: This file with project description.

<h4> Features </h4>
<br>
1)Image-based classification of potato leaf diseases.
2)Uses deep learning to accurately detect Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves.
3)Includes data preprocessing and model training steps.

<h4> How to use </h4>
<br>
1)Load the saved model from the saved model/ folder.
2)Use the notebook in model code/ to explore training and testing.
3)Modify the code or dataset as needed for your experiments.
